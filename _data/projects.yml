- title: Interactive 3D Web Portfolio
  made_for: Personal Project
  description: >-
    A game-like 3D portfolio experience built using Three.js and React.js, allowing visitors to walk around and interact with 
    various elements in a custom-designed 3D environment. The project leverages React-Three-Fiber for seamless integration of 
    Three.js with React, and features custom 3D models created in Blender. Currently a work in progress, focusing on optimizing 
    performance and adding interactive elements.
    Tech stack includes JavaScript (94%), CSS (3.1%), HTML (2.2%), and TypeScript (0.7%). 
    The web application's performance is system-dependent due to its intensive 3D rendering requirements. [Work in Progress]
